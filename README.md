A full stack CRUD Blog app (with commenting logic) made with the MERN stack. 
Users must sign in by creating an account to access the website. Users can create posts, read other users' posts, edit their posts, delete their posts and even add and remove their comments to posts. The site obviously encrypts passwords etc and was designed using stock CSS

Will brush it up after finals by including a load screen while the data is being loaded after opening the main page as well as better looking CSS
